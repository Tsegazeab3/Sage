# Conversation Log - 2025-11-09

**User:** where were we yesterday

**Agent:** I don't have a memory of our previous session. However, based on the provided file structure, it appears we are working within an Android project that integrates the NCNN deep learning inference framework, likely for an object detection application.

Please remind me of the task you'd like to continue with.

**User:** yes I think you did a filter algorithm with phones only in the mainactivit file you know why don't you log any conversation we have from now on make it so that when I open another that it reads the read me file and it continues to log and every time you finish a task don't run it but commit it

**Agent:** Okay, I understand. I will log our conversations from now on in a file named `conversation_log.md`, and I will commit changes after each task is complete.

First, I will investigate the "filter algorithm with phones only" that you mentioned. I'll start by looking for the `MainActivity.kt` file.

I've reviewed the `MainActivity.kt` file and found the filtering logic. It currently filters for "cell phone" detections.

As you requested, I will now start logging our conversation. I will create a `conversation_log.md` file for this.

Do you want to make any changes to the "cell phone" filter, or would you like me to proceed with another task? Once you confirm, I will commit any changes as you've instructed.
